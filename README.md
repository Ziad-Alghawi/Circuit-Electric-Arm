# Circuit-Electric-Arm
# Task 1 : Motor drive design and implementation for robot arm

In the beginning , I created an account on tinkercad.

Then I started making the circuit .

I used five Servo motors.

I also used an Arduino Uno R3.

I also used a small Breadboard.

Plus five potentiometers.


Then I started connecting them

At first, all the special wires were connected to the ground and power.


# After that I started connecting :

Servo 1 with pin 8.

Servo 2 with pin 9.

Servo 3 with pin 10.

Servo 4 with pin 11.

Servo 5 with pin 12.



Potentiometer 1 with pin A0.

Potentiometer 2 with pin A1.

Potentiometer 3 with pin A2.

Potentiometer 4 with pin A3.

Potentiometer 5 with pin A4.

# Then use the code you have.
